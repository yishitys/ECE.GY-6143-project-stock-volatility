## Notes

- **RMSE**: Root mean square error between predictions and true values, lower is better
- **MAE**: Mean absolute error between predictions and true values, lower is better
- **R²**: Coefficient of determination, represents proportion of variance explained by model, closer to 1 is better
- **MAPE**: Mean absolute percentage error, lower is better
- **Directional Accuracy**: Accuracy of predicting volatility change direction, higher is better
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Linear correlation coefficient between predictions and true values, closer to 1 is better
